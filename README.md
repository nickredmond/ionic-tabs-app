## Example app

### How to REALLY deploy to Android device...

1. Install Android Studio w/ Android SDK Manager
2. Install Gradle and add to PATH (learn more at https://gradle.org/install/)
3. Accept Android SDK licenses at ~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
4. Enable USB debugging on Android device

### Default Ionic Pro doesn't allow "ionic upload" command

- Instead, bang on the keyboard and then play around w/ Ionic View dashboard on the Web
- Also, this is a test to see if pushing to GitHub will actually do anything
